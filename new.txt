Make boss fights great again:

when enemy attacks:
multiple possible block strings
row of block strings at once
hp gain after perfect blocks

when player attacks:
attack learning alg 
block stamina for boss
block break with extra damage


Keep track of player input frequency, as in which blocks are used how often
 > use it for Hase BossFight
 > Track the last 100 moves in an array and keep count of how much each attack is used
  > keep track of these counters while filling the array, saves compute time

Add Improv attacks, these are rarely used(based on an enemy val) and come into play, when enemy attacks
get frequently blocked. 
 > Deal only half damage
 > Counts of blocked attacks are indivual for each spawned enemy

Engenia BossFight increases block ount each time she gets directly hit
 > Don't forget about block stamina

Rolling random attack patterns. find smallest demoninator and fill an array so that the lowest chance
option is in the array once, then shuffle the array and roll the index

try out disabling "Cancel Input", see how it feels

make list of animal names and identifier names for enemies, keep ID's as hash
